####Vision for my Site

We are all unique, built up of many layers - images, we live our lives with snap shots of our life,  past and
present. Picture Me is an interactive site whereby the user logs in via facebook and chooses 25 x images that 
represent different stages in their lives. Once all the images are uploaded they will form a 5 x 5 square grid 
and the user’s facebook profile picture will be the main image covering the entire grid. You will only see the 
individual image when you hover a section of the profile picture. This can represent an interaction in life with 
someone you don’t know. You don’t necessarily see the life stages and it’s only by chatting that you shed 
light on an experience which in turn reveals an image.
The final piece will contain all the visuals that make us unique.
